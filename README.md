# effects-benchmarks

This is a set of memory and time benchmarks for the various Haskell effects libraries, including `fused-effects`, `polysemy`, `freer-simple`, and `extensible-effects`. Benchmarks for equivalent `mtl` and handwritten computations are included for comparison purposes. It uses Cabal's new Backpack feature to save a great deal of boilerplate code.

# tl;dr

`fused-effects` and `mtl` achieve roughly commensurate performance. `polysemy` is within one to three orders of magnitude from `fused-effects` and `mtl`. `freer-simple` and `extensible-effects` are considerably slower.

# Full results

On a 15-inch 2017 MacBook Pro (3.1GHz Intel i7, 16GB RAM), here are results for space benchmarks:

```
Countdown

  Case                Allocated
  fused-effects              40
  mtl                        40
  polysemy                1,304
  freer-simple            1,096
  extensible-effects      1,304
  shallow                   232

Countdown + exc

  Case                Allocated  GCs
  fused-effects             336
  mtl                       336
  polysemy                  792
  freer-simple              864
  extensible-effects        984
  shallow                   320
```

(The fact that `fused-effects` and `mtl` have the same allocations is not an error; `fused-effects` was designed to have almost identical performance characteristics to `mtl`.)

# Future work
* More benchmarks: `Writer`, logging, `grammar`, `pipes`.
* I am going to make this emit pretty graphs, or at least graphable .csv files, someday.
